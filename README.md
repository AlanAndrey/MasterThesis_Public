# MasterThesis_Public
Public repo of my master thesis used to share code without the clutter

General Structure:
-Cilia houses the custom code used for the various tasks while the other folders are used to store the data and the results of the experiments.

If you want to run the code, you should download all the files from the following Onedrive Repo:
https://unibe365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/alan_andrey_students_unibe_ch/EYRBOlTJ3K1Jl9O8B3OIhdgB-0eM-CNwbS_wjcoW10QtFA?e=LrkTuv
Unzip the files and place them in the top level of the repo.
